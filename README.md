# LAB17 Application

**Author**: Joshua Fredrickson
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
Lab 17 is an informational storage API that accepts HTTP CRUD requests into a Mongo Data Base.


## Getting Started
To use the Lab17 application, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) 
(Node Package manager), and [Mongo DB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)  will need
 to be locally installed.  Once Node.js, npm, Mongo DB have been installed, install the Lab17 
 files.  
 Prior to starting the Lab17 application, from the command line while you are in the Lab17 file 
 folder, enter the command `npm i`.  This will download all needed dependencies for the 
 application to run.   


## Architecture
This application was deployed with the following technologies.
Node.js, npm, body-parser, dotenv, express, faker, mongoose, winston, babel, superagent, json web
 tokens, http-errors, jest, eslint, JavaScript
